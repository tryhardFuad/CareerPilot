/**
 * Parse a CV file (PDF or DOCX) into raw plain text.
 *
 * - PDF:  `pdf-parse` v2 (the `PDFParse` class). We use this in
 *         preference to `unpdf`/`pdfjs` for one specific reason:
 *         pdf-parse preserves the line breaks that the PDF's text
 *         drawing operators emit, so headers like "Education" stay
 *         on their own line. `unpdf`'s `mergePages` join collapses
 *         those line breaks, which left the chunker with a single
 *         long string and no detectable section boundaries.
 *         (This module is `runtime = "nodejs"`, so the v2 class
 *         which uses pdfjs under the hood is fine — see
 *         `next.config.ts`.)
 * - DOCX: `mammoth.extractRawText` → plain text. DOCX is a ZIP of
 *         XML, so the result is already UTF-8.
 *
 * Throws on:
 *   - Unknown extension
 *   - Malformed PDF/DOCX bytes
 *   - Empty buffer

// pdf-parse v2 uses pdfjs-dist under the hood. In Node.js, pdfjs's
// fake-worker bootstrap still tries to `import(this.workerSrc)` and
// throws "Setting up fake worker failed: Cannot find module
// './pdf.worker.mjs'" if workerSrc is left as its relative default —
// because in a Next.js server bundle there is no `pdf.worker.mjs`
// sitting next to the chunk. We resolve the worker file from the
// installed `pdfjs-dist` package and point pdfjs at it via a
// `file://` URL. This is the supported setup; pdfjs then runs the
// worker module on the main thread (it's all in the same Node
// process anyway, so there's no perf cost for a one-shot CV parse).
//
// We do this lazily on the first call rather than at module-import
// time, because (a) we want to avoid the resolution cost in any
// route that imports `parseCv` but never parses a PDF, and (b) we
// also need the `pdf-parse` ESM module to be loaded by the time
// `PDFParse.setWorker` is invoked, which only happens once the class
// has been imported and used at least once.

  // result is identical.
  //
  // For the Vercel deployment trace we don't need the path to be
  // visible in source: `next.config.ts` declares an
  // `outputFileTracingIncludes` entry that glob-matches the file
